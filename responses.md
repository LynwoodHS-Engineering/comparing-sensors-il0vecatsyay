A1) The actual physical process allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense its environment is facilitated by the ultrasonic camera, which can detect the distance from a hand. It sends a signal that allows autonomous systems to respond and print.

A2) Some environmental factors that might influence and mess up the performance of these sensors may be the light levels that can disrupt the sensors' readings, Temperature that can affect the sensors' accuracy, and electromagnetic interference in noisy environments that can distort the accuracy.

A3) The role that coding plays in this is to get the correct code to make sure the sensors can interact with the environment and control. The code makes sure how the code can command and react to the sensors.
