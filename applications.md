Sensors are critical in autonomous robotic systems because they allow the robot to understand its internal state and external environment which allows it to work independently. Active sensors like the ultrasonic allow it to send signals to detect its surroundings such as being able to measure distances or see any obstacles. Passive sensors like microphones allow it to hear and recognize its environmental area. Proprioceptive sensors which is gives feedback on the robot to see how its doing with all the power transmitted. Lastly exteroceptive sensors which gathers data for the robot such as whats going on around the robot, the light around it, and the temperature. These are what the sensors do to make sure the autonomous robotic systems succeed.
